## Code Review
By Viktor Puke
* Try to keep it your code consistent  and decide if you want to go for camelCasing, kebab-casing or snake_casing.
- ~~class “Menu” with capital letter~~
- author_id. -- Needed to change the  entire article Table to change this column name so I didn't have the time.
- basically the rest is camelCasing.
* ~~Try and add image alt tag for accessibility.~~
* Good job on keeping the code DRY, requiring header and footer from separate files.
* ~~Some final CSS touches is needed.~~
* ~~Don’t forget to declare strict types WITH comments~~
/
* Description
*
* @param type $variable
* @param type $variable
*
* @return type
* */
*
Overall really good job, writing clear code that is easily understandable.
